# build script to take Alan’s alignments and transform them into vcf files

run phasedalign-to-vcf.py per individual

# compare my phased variants to Alan’s phase variants

will need to compare vcf files, see which variants fall under either "shared", "jockusch-only" or "lemmon-only"

# build script which takes phased variants and transforms them into completed alignments

try https://github.com/Bahler-Lab/alignment-from-vcf
but will need to capture indels as well
